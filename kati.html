    <h3>KATI KATI</h3>

  For anyone who cares to listen, I tell them Kati Kati is probably my favourite Kenyan film so far. It’s also the movie that publicly changed the Kenyan game.

For starters, the 2016 film premiered in Nairobi during the first edition of NBO Film Fest – the brainchild of Mbithi Masya and Sheba Hirst that showcases award-winning African indie films. The Kenyan movie also made news when it won at the Toronto International Film Festival … then everybody wanted to see it. Including myself.

Kati Kati has a unique storyline that you can’t see even with the strongest binoculars. It’s about the mystical afterlife which we rarely think about yet secretly haunts us. What will happen to us when we die? And will we be able to face our darkest demons?

Other than Elsaphan Njora’s sobering acting, I fell in love with the movie soundtrack. Especially the final track Find Us A Way by Mayonde, the director’s gorgeous wife. It always sends goosebumps all over my body, which is how the award-winning movie by Mbithi left me.</p>
