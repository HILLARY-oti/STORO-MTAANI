  <h3>RAFIKI</h3>
  <img src="images/rafiki.jpg" alt="">
  <p>
    If you’re like me, you probably heard about Kenyan filmmaker Wanuri Kahiu thanks to the fantastical Africa Nouveau
    Festival. She’s the one behind the Afrobubblegum theme: fun, fierce and frivolous. There’s even a TED talk about it.

    Something else you should know about Wanuri: she directed the award-winning sci-fi short film “Pumzi” which screened
    at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. And her 2018 movie Rafiki became the first Kenyan film to premiere at the Cannes
    Film Festival. Big deal by the way!

    Wanuri says “Rafiki” was inspired by the 2007 Caine Prize winner “Jambula Tree” by Monica Arac de Nyeko, a novel
    about two girls in love in Uganda. She dared to tell her own lesbian love story of two “rafikis” in this
    conservative country of ours. And to make matters worse, their families are on opposite political sides.

    Just like Supa Modo, the 2018 film boasts a full Kenyan cast and soundtrack. It was the first time on screen for
    Samantha Mugatsia “Sam” the drummer of Yellow Light Machine as Kena and another run for seasoned actress Sheila
    Munyiva as the colourful Ziki.

    Stylist Wambui Thimba dressed both lead actresses in Peperuka, Chilli Mango and other made in Kenya fashion brands.
    And in the background of their complicated love drama was fierce music from Kenyan female musicians Muthoni Drummer
    Queen, Chemutai Sage, Trina Mungai and Mumbi Kasumba. Yes, it was a #SHE affair.

    But my favourite soundtrack has to be Njoki Karu’s Secret Love.
