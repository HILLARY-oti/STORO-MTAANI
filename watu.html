  <h2>WATU WOTE</h2>

  <p style="text-align:center;">
    You’ve might have heard of this short film that made it to the Oscars. Yes, the one and only Oscars. It’s a
    Kenyan-German production by graduates from Hamburg Media School in Germany and the Africa Digital Media Institute
    (ADMI) in Nairobi. Speaking of, how many film colleges in Kenya do you know?

    Well, Watu Wote made history in 2017 as the first Kenyan film nominated in the category of the best short
    live-action film at the 90th Oscars. The Kenyan team proudly dazzled in their African red carpet outfits at Dolby
    Theatre, Hollywood while brushing shoulders with the Wakanda Nation. How do I know this? They showed off the photos
    after a screening at Nairobi Film Festival 2018.

    They didn’t win the Oscar but won a lot of hearts and cheers that night at Prestige Cinema. I was left mopping my
    eyes after realizing the short film is based on a true story. The 26-minute film about a Mandera bus attack goes
    beyond terrorism and Al Shabaab to demonstrate a story of humanity and compassion. Because yes, there is hope in
    Kenya.
