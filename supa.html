   <h3>SUPA MODO</h3>

   <p>
     This 2018 Kenyan movie had an unforgettable premiere at NBO Film Fest 2 in May 2018. I remember Prestige Cinema was so packed during the second screening that a couple had to sit on the stairs in order to get a satisfying view. Some attendees from the premier night even came to watch it again.

    In all of the 5 African movies I watched during the Nairobi Film Festival, this was the one that received a standing ovation. From Kenyans. And solicited a lot of tears, even from grown men.

    The family drama is about a young girl who dreams of being a superhero but her health says otherwise. Starting as a wild idea from her elder sister, her village decides to make her childish dream come true. The plot is almost fantastical, but the Kikuyu dialogue and rural environment made it ever relatable.

     I was so proud to hear Kenyan music playing throughout the movie, starting with Don Ngartia’s Mirabelle and later Just A Band. This project also involved the creative minds of Kenyan musician Silas Miami, filmmaker Mugambi Nthiga and the video producer Enos Olik.
     (Fun fact: Did you know Jo’s elder sister is the same girl in Ayrosh’s music video for Shuga Mami? Yup, I was shocked too.)
 Supa Modo was only meant for NBO. Instead, it ended up screening for almost 2 months in Nairobi and Mombasa. Even Nigerian artist Mr Eazi who was in town caught it at the cinema. I think these raving reactions on Twitter had something to do with it.

 The director Likarion Wainaina must be such a happy man. The 2018 movie has already won 21 awards in total including at the local Riverwood Awards and has screened in over 30 film festivals around the world. It was also submitted as Kenya’s official submission to the Oscars 2019.

 And to think the film idea started with a dream. Like an actual sleep dream.
