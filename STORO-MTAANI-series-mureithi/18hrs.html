    <h3>18 HOURS</h3>

      Here’s another award-winning Kenyan movie that was inspired by a true story. The main stars are media personality Nick Ndeda and actor Brian Ogola from Too Early for Birds – who honestly stole the show.

The two show up as a Kenyan paramedic and ambulance driver respectively stuck with a road accident victim for 18 hours because they can’t find an available hospital. And we follow them on a gruelling journey as they run out of time to save his life.

18 hours brought the sad story of Kenyan healthcare closer home. It truly touched a lot of emotions. I almost couldn’t believe the tears that burst out of me, seeing the anguish of the helpless widow played by Sue Wanjiru.

After the free movie screening at Alliance Francaise thanks to European Film Festival, we had a Q&A session with the movie director Njue Kevin and a couple of medical experts. We learnt from them that the family of Alex Madaga was compensated and there’s a health bill drafted to prevent such an unnecessary death from happening again. They even gave us ambulance contact cards to pass to our family members. Because free emergency care is a right for every Kenyan.
With time 18 hours caught the right world attention. It won three awards at Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards 2018 in Nigeria for Best Film Editor, Best East African movie (previously won by Kati Kati), and Best Film Overall. They were received by the proud producer Phoebe Ruguru.
